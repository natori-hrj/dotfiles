I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore your codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see you're working in a portfolio project at `/Users/al4ud1de/work/portfolio`. The repository is clean with an initial commit.\n\nTo get started, I'd be happy to:\n- Explore the current structure of your codebase\n- Understand what technologies and frameworks you're using\n- Help design implementation plans for new features\n- Analyze existing patterns and conventions\n\nWhat would you like me to help you with today? Feel free to share:\n- Requirements for a new feature you'd like to implement\n- Questions about the current codebase structure\n- Any specific area you'd like me to explore\n\nRemember, I'm in read-only planning mode - I'll explore your code and design detailed implementation plans, but won't modify any files directly."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":936,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWk4TNEa3FeammwSrN1MY","type":"assistant","uuid":"d5dd0d37-5434-4c3d-9be0-d62d393492d0","timestamp":"2026-01-03T07:36:13.157Z"}
